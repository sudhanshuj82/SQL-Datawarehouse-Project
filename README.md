# 📊 Modern Data Warehouse & Analytics Project

Welcome to my portfolio project showcasing the design and implementation of a modern **data warehouse and analytics solution** using **SQL Server**. This project demonstrates how raw operational data can be transformed into valuable business insights using a layered architecture and robust ETL processes.

---

## 🧱 Architecture Overview

This solution follows the **Medallion Architecture** (Bronze, Silver, Gold) to structure the data transformation process effectively:

- **🔹 Bronze Layer:** Raw data ingested directly from CSV files into SQL Server — no transformation applied.
- **🔘 Silver Layer:** Data cleaning, validation, and standardization to create a reliable and query-friendly dataset.
- **🟡 Gold Layer:** Business-ready analytical data modeled into a **Star Schema**, optimized for reporting and decision-making.

## 🚀 Project Highlights

This end-to-end project includes:

- **ETL Development:** Building custom SQL-based pipelines to extract, transform, and load data from CRM and ERP sources.
- **Dimensional Modeling:** Creating **Fact and Dimension** tables to support analytical workloads.
- **SQL Analytics:** Writing queries to analyze customer behavior, sales performance, and product trends.
- **Best Practices:** Implementation of naming conventions, modular scripts, and clear documentation to mirror real-world engineering standards.
